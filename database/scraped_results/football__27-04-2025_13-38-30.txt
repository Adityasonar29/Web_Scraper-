  title: Cristiano Ronaldo: From Poverty to Family and Football Superstardom
  body_content: Cristiano Ronaldo: From Poverty to Family and Football Superstardom Cristiano Ronaldo: From Poverty to Family and Football Superstardom 5 minute read By SPYSCAPE | @SPYSCAPE | The Portuguese football legend is the most followed person on Instagram but he is also a superhero for his charitable work. Cristiano Ronaldo's family helps him stay grounded but they can also break his heart at times. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was reduced to tears when recently shown a videotaped interview of his late father conducted in 2004, a year before his death. While José Dinis Aveiro said he was proud of his son, Cristiano’s father explained that he’d prefer to watch the Euro 2004 championship at rather than at the stadium in Lisbon, Portugal. “My nerves are too much. I get too anxious. I can’t do it.” Cristiano Rinaldo, age 19, scored his first international goal at Euro 2004 Cristiano Rinaldo: A Legend Cristiano was knocked down by his father’s comments and overwhelmed with memories of growing up with an alcoholic father who died when Cristiano was 20. He regretted they never really had a proper conversation, he explained, and that his father didn’t live long enough to see Cristiano rise to fame or share in the joy of his awards. “My father, he saw nothing. He died young. But it is what it is,” Cristiano said, wiping away tears. Arguably the greatest footballer on earth (his rivalry with Lionel Messi is the stuff of legend), Cristiano still wonders if his success was due to his father watching over him from heaven. While his life was far from perfect, it was José Dinis Aveiro who introduced Cristiano to football - known as soccer in America - and guided him to become the man he is today. Cristiano Ronaldo is not just competitive and driven, but also anxious to improve the world for the sake of his six children and those he touches through his work with Save the Children and other charities . ‍ Share     Cristiano Ronaldo: From Poverty to Family and Football Superstardom By SPYSCAPE 5 Minute Read Share This story is part of our weekly briefing.

Cristiano Ronaldo is not just competitive and driven, but also anxious to improve the world for the sake of his six children and those he touches through his work with Save the Children and other charities . ‍ Date Nights at SPYSCAPE Two VIP tickets for just $79 at NYC's #1 Rated Experience Book Now ‍ True superhero Cristiano Ronaldo has never lacked in self-confidence, once telling an interviewer: “Most of the time, I inspired myself. I'm self-motivated.” His background is the key to understanding his relentless drive, however. It was a long, difficult climb for Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, born in 1985 and named after his father’s favorite actor Ronald Reagan. He grew up in Madeira, Portugal, a volcanic island in the North Atlantic where the shops are now packed with Ronaldo football jerseys, hats, mugs, and backpacks. There’s a Ronaldo bronze statue to greet visitors at the airport - named, of course, Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport - and a CR7 Museum to display his trophies and sell miniature golden boots. ‍ Cristiano Renaldo’s epic journey Cristiano was a proud but troubled boy, the youngest of four children. His mother was a cook and a cleaner. The family was so poor his mother, Dolores Aveiro, considered terminating her pregnancy and tried a made recipe, she revealed in her book Mother Courage. "He told me when he found out, 'Look mum, you wanted to abort me and now I'm the one who's pulling the purse-strings in the house," Dolores later recalled. Cristiano had trouble controlling his temper and was expelled from school for throwing a chair at a teacher. He assumed he’d become a village fisherman and wasn’t interested in academics. Cristiano was obsessed with football, however, and quit school at age 14 to practice full time. Cristiano with his father (far left), mother and siblings Football, football and football His father served in the Portuguese Army and fought two wars in Angola and Mozambique, returning to unemployment and difficult times although he later found work as a kit man at the local football club where Cristiano played for CF Andorinha. Cristiano joined Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then Sporting Clube de Portugal before debuting on Sporting's first team in 2002. Even a heart operation at age 15 couldn’t keep him away from the pitch. "All he wanted to do as a boy was play football," his godfather, Fernao Sousa, told British reporters. "He loved the game so much he'd miss meals or escape out of his bedroom window with a ball when he was supposed to be doing his work." Cristiano Ronaldo comes of age By 18, he’d signed with Manchester United, winning the FA Cup in his first season, then went on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup. By age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or and, at the time, he was involved in the most expensive association football transfer ever when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 - a transfer worth €94m ($107m). Cristiano eventually ended up back at Man United after his time with Real Madrid and a successful period with Italian giant Juventus . Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed $1bn in career earnings in 2021 ‍ Personal ups and downs Ronaldo and his girlfriend Georgina Rodríguez have been together since 2017 and they share responsibility for their children including a son, Ronaldo Jr. "If you don't have family, life will be very, very tough," Cristian said, reflecting in his biographical film Ronaldo (2015) . While family and football have been Cristian’s salvation, he’s faced difficulties throughout his career - he can be temperamental on and off the pitch, particular if he’s not scoring goals. His personal life has also been a source of drama and trauma. American model and teacher Kathryn Mayorga accused the footballer of raping her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 and the police investigation was re-opened in 2018 - a year Cristiano has described as possibly the worst year of his life . The District Attorney's office declined to prosecute however, AP reported . The athlete repeatedly denied the accusations, calling rape an “abominable crime that goes against everything I am and believe in”. ‍ Cristiano with four-year-old twins Eva Maria and Mateo (left), Alana Martina, 4, and Cristiano Jr., 11 What's next for Cristiano? When he’s not at practice or with his family, Cristiano has made philanthropy his prime focus. He is an ambassador for three major charities, Save the Children, Unicef and World Vision, and has spoken up for many . He sold off his 2013 Ballon d'Or, raising than $800,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation which helps children with critical illnesses. He also sold his 2011 European Golden Boot award for scoring 40 goals under Jose Mourinho, raising $1.6m for school construction in war-torn Gaza. Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes later donated $1.35m to Portuguese causes during the coronavirus pandemic and asked the Portugal squad to donate 50% of their qualifying bonus for Euro 2020 to help Covid-19 sufferers. What’s next for Ronaldo? He is still in demand on the pitch - even if he is on the wrong side of 35. When Cristiano moved to Saudi Arabia in 2023 to join Al-Nassr (which means 'Victory' in Arabic), sports fans shifted their attention to the Middle Eastern country. Al-Nassr's Instagram jumped from 800,000 followers to than 14m. He remains just as talented and divisive as ever. He's a perfectionist and a demanding teammate - and Cristiano doesn’t seem to have any incentive to change that, once admitting: “I don’t mind people hating me, because it pushes me.” SPYSCAPE+ Join now to get True Spies episodes early and ad-free every week, plus r-only Debriefs and Q&As to bring you closer to your favorite spies and stories from the show.

Ronaldo is the winner of five Ballon d’Or awards (2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017), and in 2024 he became the first men’s player to score 900 career goals in official matches. Early life and career Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honor of his father’s favorite movie actor, Ronald Reagan , who was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002. A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 meters), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses. Britannica Quiz Great Moments in Sports Quiz Club play After a successful season with Sporting that brought the young player to the attention of Europe’s biggest football clubs, Ronaldo signed with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003. He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of the best forwards in the game. His finest season with United came in 2007–08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League title in May 2008, Ronaldo captured Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honors for his stellar 2007–08 season.

() Soon thereafter Ronaldo was sold to Spain’s Real Madrid —a club with which he had long been rud to want to play—for a then record £80 million ( $131 million) transfer fee. His scoring prowess continued with his new team, and he netted the most goals (40) in La Liga history during the 2010–11 season (his record was broken the following season by his rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona). In 2011–12 Ronaldo helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best 46 goals during the League season. He scored a total of 66 goals in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese national team in 2013 to earn his second world player of the year award (the FIFA World Player of the Year was renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010). In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a Champions League title, which resulted in Ronaldo capturing another Ballon d’Or award. In 2014–15 he netted 48 goals to lead La Liga in scoring. Ronaldo netted his 324th goal as a member of Real in October 2015 to become the club’s all-time leading goal scorer. He scored 35 La Liga goals in 2015–16 and helped Real win its record 11th Champions League title, and in December 2016 he won a fourth career Ballon d’Or for his accomplishments. Ronaldo scored 42 goals for Real across all competitions in 2016–17 and led his team to La Liga and Champions League titles that season, which resulted in a fifth career Ballon d’Or award. In 2017–18 he scored 44 goals in 44 games, and Real won a third straight Champions League title. In July 2018 he reached a four-year contract worth €112 million ( $132 million) with the Italian powerhouse Juventus . He finished his Real career with 311 goals in 292 matches. He scored 28 goals in his first season with Juventus—his lowest domestic goal total since his last season with Manchester United—as the powerhouse club won its eighth straight Italian league title. In the 2019–20 season Ronaldo helped the club capture another league title, and Juventus later won the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana and the 2021 Coppa Italia Final. Several months after the latter match, he left Juventus and returned to Manchester United. His second stint with the club proved disappointing, however. Both Ronaldo and Manchester struggled, and he expressed growing dissatisfaction with the club. In November 2022 his contract was terminated by “mutual agreement.” The following month Ronaldo signed with the Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr.

() 2 of 2 Cristiano Ronaldo Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo (center) in a match against Ireland, 2014. () On his soil, after moving through the youth and under-21 ranks, Ronaldo had made his first appearance for Portugal’s full national team against Kazakhstan in August 2003 (four days after his debut for United). He was a key player in Portugal’s fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup and became the full-time captain of the national team in 2008. In 2012 his stellar play led Portugal to the semifinals of the European Championship , where his team was eliminated by rival Spain in a match that was decided by a penalty kick shoot-out. Ronaldo came into the 2014 World Cup hot off of his second world player of the year win, but his play at the tournament was spotty, and the entire Portugal team struggled during a group-stage elimination. In 2016 Ronaldo helped Portugal win the European Championship, the country’s first major international tournament title, although he only played sparingly in the final because of a knee injury that he had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo played brilliantly at the 2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games as Portugal advanced to the knockout round only to lose its first match of that stage to a strong defensive Uruguay side. Four years later Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five different World Cups. However, he was not part of the starting lineup for several games, and Portugal’s 2022 World Cup ended with a loss in the quarterfinals. In a UEFA Nations League group stage match against Croatia in 2024, Ronaldo scored his 900th career goal, becoming the first men’s player to accomplish the feat. Endorsements and legal issues A football legend Cristiano Ronaldo, 2017. () Ronaldo was one of the most well-known sports stars off the field, and numerous studies of athletes’ popularity showed that he was the most-beloved athlete in the world during his playing peak. His extreme popularity made Ronaldo one of the highest-paid endorsers in sports history, and in November 2016 he became the third person (after basketball superstars Michael Jordan and LeBron James ) to earn a “lifetime” contract from the sportswear company Nike . over, he established his own successful “CR7” brand of products that included shoes, underwear, and fragrances. Ronaldo’s immense marketability was at the center of a legal issue that arose in June 2017. That month prosecutors filed a lawsuit that accused Ronaldo of defrauding the Spanish government of €14.7 million ($16.5 million) by hiding his image-rights income in Spain from 2011 to 2014. He was accused of having underestimated the income he earned from the sale and licensing of his image rights and the accompanying tax obligations, but Ronaldo denied all allegations. However, in June 2018 he accepted a suspended two-year prison sentence and agreed to pay €18.8 million ($21.8 million) to the Spanish government to settle the case.

Born on February 5, 1985, in Madeira, Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo hailed from a poor family and was the youngest of four siblings. His mother worked as a cook and cleaner while his father was a gardener. Cristiano Ronaldo, from a young age, chose to pursue football as a career and started playing for local team Andorinha, where his father worked as a part-time kit man. After three years with Andorinha and two with Nacional, Cristiano Ronaldo was signed up by Sporting CP, one of the biggest clubs in Portugal, in 1997 after impressing during a trial with the Lisbon-based team. Ronaldo had to move to Lisbon away from his family in Madeira to continue his development with Sporting’s youth system. At the age of 15, Ronaldo had to undergo surgery to correct racing heart. The condition is a form of tachycardia which implies that someone’s resting heart rate was faster than normal. The issue could have ended Ronaldo’s football career permanently but the surgery was successful and there was no looking back. He made his senior debut for Sporting at 17 in 2002 but didn’t stay at the club for long as he joined Premier League giants Manchester United a year later. In fact, it was his performance against United during an exhibition match to mark the unveiling of Estádio José Alvalade, Sporting’s new Stadium, that convinced legendary coach Sir Alex Ferguson to break the bank and bring the teenager to Old Trafford. It was at United that Ronaldo, under the guidance of Sir Alex, developed into a world-class player. During his six-year stint at Old Trafford, Ronaldo won three Premier League titles, a UEFA Champions League and his first Ballon d'Or in 2008, signalling his arrival as a global superstar. In 2009, Ronaldo realised his childhood dream of signing for Spanish giants Real Madrid, who paid a then-world-record fee to bring the ace attacker to the Santiago Bernabeu. Through his nine seasons with Los Blancos, Ronaldo became the club’s all-time leading scorer with 450 goals in 438 appearances. He also won four Champions League titles, two La Liga crowns and claimed four Ballon d'Ors, solidifying his place as a legend of the game. With 140 goals in 183 matches, Cristiano Ronaldo is also the all-time highest goal scorer in the UEFA Champions League. In 2018, Ronaldo moved to Italian outfit Juventus, with whom he won two Serie A titles and scored over 100 goals. He returned to Manchester United in 2021 under huge fanfare before moving to Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in 2023. Only Lionel Messi, with seven, has won Ballon d’Ors than Cristiano Ronaldo. Cristiano Ronaldo’s numbers on the international stage is as impressive as his club career. Since making his international debut for Portugal in 2003, Cristiano Ronaldo led Portugal to victory in the 2016 UEFA European Championship and the 2019 UEFA Nations League. With over 130 goals in than 200 appearances, Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the records for most goals scored and most matches played in international football. He has also represented Portugal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is a global icon, known for his philanthropy and business ventures, including his CR7 brand.

This article is part of a series Cristiano Ronaldo Portuguese professional footballer Career International goals Achievements Rivalry with Lionel Messi Eponyms and public art Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport Estádio da Madeira Museu CR7 Films The World at His Feet (2014) Ronaldo (2015) Family Kátia Aveiro Georgina Rodríguez Related Galaxy CR7 v t e Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr and the Portugal national team . His individual achievements include five Ballon d'Or awards, the most for a European player. His exceptional goal-scoring ability, explosive speed, powerful knuckleball shots, and dribbling skills cemented his legacy as one of the greatest and most iconic footballers in history. In recognition of his record-breaking goalscoring success, Ronaldo received special awards for Outstanding Career Achievement by FIFA in 2021 and Champions League All-Time Top Scorer by UEFA in 2024. Ronaldo joined Sporting CP 's youth academy and made the first team in August 2002. A sought after player, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12 million in August 2003, an England record for a teenager. After an individually and collectively successful six-year period where Ronaldo evolved into a world class attacker, he transferred to his "dream club" Real Madrid in 2009 for a then world record £80 million. He spent nine seasons in Madrid, enjoying tremendous success and setting numerous records, including becoming the club's record goalscorer with 450 goals and being integral to the club winning four Champions League titles in a five-year span. Tensions with the hierarchy of Real Madrid resulted in Ronaldo joining Juventus in 2018 for €100 million, where he went on to win all the major honours in Italian football. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, before signing with Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in January 2023, reportedly receiving the highest football salary in history. Ronaldo's move increased the popularity of the Saudi Pro League , attracting other high-profile players. Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 aged 18 and has earned than 200 caps , making him history's most-capped male player . With than 100 international goals, he is the all-time top male goalscorer . Ronaldo has played in twelve major tournaments: five FIFA World Cups , five UEFA European Championships , and two UEFA Nations Leagues . He assumed captaincy of Portugal in 2008, and in 2015 was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation . The following year, he led Portugal to win UEFA Euro 2016 , the country's first major title. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals , and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020 . The same tournament, he broke the record of most international goals scored in men's football and became the player with the most international caps in men's football in 2023. The following year, he became the player with the most international victories in men's football. Club career [ edit ] Sporting CP [ edit ] See also: 2002–03 Sporting CP season Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni , who was impressed with his dribbling . [ 1 ] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season. [ 2 ] On 14 August 2002, [ 3 ] Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the first team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th [ 3 ] minute in place of Toñito . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] As far as the Portuguese football league system is concerned, Sporting CP B was the first team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2–1 away loss against Sport Clube Lusitânia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divisão B championship played in the Azores . [ 6 ] On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga , playing for Sporting CP's first team against Braga , and on 7 October, he scored two goals against irense in their 3–0 win. [ 7 ] Over the course of the 2002–03 season , his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta . [ 8 ] Manager Arsène Wenger , who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal 's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer. [ 9 ] Some other teams discussed with the Portuguese team to approach for a possibile transfer, like the French teams Auxerre and Lyon . [ 10 ] In October 2002, Juventus scout Gianni Di Marzio , one of the club's 23 ones, presented Ronaldo's profile to executive Luciano Moggi who prepared a €2.5 million offer for Sporting CP, including Marcelo Salas in exchange. [ 10 ] Salas then refused to accept the transfer and the talks collapsed. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. [ 12 ] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million [ 12 ] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen. [ 13 ] A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member. [ 14 ] Manchester United [ edit ] 2003–2007: Development and breakthrough [ edit ] See also: 2003–04 Manchester United F.C. season , 2004–05 Manchester United F.C. season , 2005–06 Manchester United F.C. season , and 2006–07 Manchester United F.C. season "There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me." —Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003. [ 15 ] Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season , and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. [ 16 ] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. [ 17 ] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best , Eric Cantona and David Beckham . [ 18 ] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. [ 19 ] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career." [ 20 ] Ronaldo playing for Manchester United against Chelsea during the 2005–06 Premier League season Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt . [ 21 ] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen. [ 15 ] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. [ 22 ] Three league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, [ 23 ] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career. [ 24 ] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final , earning his first trophy. [ 25 ] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. [ 26 ] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, [ 27 ] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player. [ 28 ] "He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening." —Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season. [ 26 ] Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough . [ 29 ] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. [ 30 ] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season , producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out , United lost 5–4. [ 33 ] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup , after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic . [ 34 ] During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a " one-fingered gesture " towards Benfica fans, [ 35 ] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City 's former United player Andy Cole . [ 36 ] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. [ 37 ] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup , in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, [ 38 ] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. [ 39 ] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club. [ 40 ] Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season , [ 41 ] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title . An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen , who taught him to make himself unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. [ 42 ] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours. [ 46 ] 2007–2008: Collective and individual success [ edit ] See also: 2007–08 Manchester United F.C. season Ronaldo playing for Manchester United during the 2006–07 Premier League season At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League , Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition, [ 47 ] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma . [ 48 ] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan , which ended in a 3–2 win, [ 49 ] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro . [ 50 ] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final , but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat. [ 51 ] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years. [ 52 ] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association 's Player's Player , Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association 's Footballer of the Year award, [ 53 ] [ 54 ] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. [ 55 ] His wages were raised to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. [ 56 ] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or , [ 57 ] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi , in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award. [ 58 ] Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. [ 59 ] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win. [ 60 ] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. [ 61 ] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot , [ 62 ] as well as the European Golden Shoe , which made him the first winger to win the latter award. [ 63 ] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate; [ 66 ] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma. [ 67 ] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, [ 68 ] United emerged victorious, winning 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw at the end of 120 minutes. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] As the Champions League top scorer , Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year . [ 71 ] Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season , his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. [ 72 ] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid , United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. [ 73 ] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as "modern slavery". [ 74 ] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter, [ 75 ] he remained at United for another year. [ 76 ] 2008–2009: Ballon d'Or and continued success [ edit ] See also: 2008–09 Manchester United F.C. season Ronaldo in 2009 with Manchester United playing in a Premier League game against Liverpool Ahead of the 2008–09 season , on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, [ 77 ] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. [ 78 ] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November, [ 79 ] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time. [ 80 ] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, [ 81 ] assisting the final -winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process. [ 82 ] With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year , Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, [ 83 ] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year . [ 84 ] His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto , a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award , presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; [ 85 ] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. [ 86 ] United advanced to the final in Rome, [ 87 ] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona. [ 88 ] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup . [ 89 ] [ 90 ] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four appearances. [ 91 ] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford . [ 92 ] Real Madrid [ edit ] As his usual number 7 was unavailable, Ronaldo wore number 9 during his debut season at Madrid. After Raúl departed the club, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the 2010–11 season . Ahead of the 2009–10 season , Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million (€94 million). [ 93 ] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause. [ 94 ] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu , surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli . [ 95 ] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, [ 96 ] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano . [ 97 ] 2009–2013: World record transfer and La Liga title [ edit ] See also: 2009–10 Real Madrid CF season , 2010–11 Real Madrid CF season , 2011–12 Real Madrid CF season , and 2012–13 Real Madrid CF season Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 win. [ 98 ] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. [ 99 ] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich . [ 100 ] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería . [ 103 ] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga, [ 104 ] [ 105 ] and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season . Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league , he did not win a trophy in his first season. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season . [ 108 ] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October. [ 109 ] Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao , Levante , Villarreal and Málaga . [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or . [ 113 ] During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final , winning his first trophy in Spain. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.

[ 450 ] This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini , as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history. [ 451 ] He also became the first player to score at five Euros, [ 452 ] and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, [ 453 ] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. [ 454 ] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's original record of 109 international goals.

[ 456 ] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick ) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot .

[ note 2 ] On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos 's record for the most international caps received by a European player . [ 461 ] [ 462 ] In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, thus becoming the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football , [ 463 ] and with his third goal, he overtook Daei to become the second-highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifiers with 36 goals, only behind Carlos Ruiz . [ 464 ] On 29 March 2022, Portugal secured qualification for the World Cup with a 2–0 victory over North Macedonia ; Ronaldo assisted the opening goal by Bruno Fernandes.

On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups. [ 466 ] In the last group game against South Korea , Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted. [ 467 ] He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland , marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, [ 468 ] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000 . [ 469 ] He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6–1, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup , with Ronaldo's replacement Gonçalo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. [ 470 ] Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa 's international appearance record, becoming the joint–most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1–0, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals. [ 471 ] [ 472 ] 2023–present: Later years [ edit ] UEFA Euro 2024 [ edit ] See also: UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying and UEFA Euro 2024 Following the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Martínez , Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. [ 473 ] On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4–0 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time. [ 474 ] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers , as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. [ 475 ] On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3–2 win over Slovakia , leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024 , marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history. [ 476 ] On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina , with Ronaldo scoring twice. [ 477 ] The landmark goals saw him score in than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s). [ 478 ] [ 479 ] On 21 May 2024, he was selected in the 26-man squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 . [ 480 ] In the opening match against the Czech Republic , on 18 June, he became the first player to appear at six European Championships, [ 481 ] and in doing so at the age of 39, he became the second oldest outfield player in the competition's history, only behind his teammate Pepe, who achieved his record on the same day. [ 482 ] On 22 June, Ronaldo assisted Portugal's third goal in a 3–0 win against Turkey , securing his country's qualification to the knockout phase . This made him the outright all-time highest assist-provider in the competition since 1968, with seven assists, as well as the oldest player ever to assist a goal in the competition at 39 years. [ 483 ] On 26 June, he started in Portugal's final group stage match against Georgia to become the first European player to make 50 appearances at major international tournaments. [ 484 ] Just like in the first two matches of the Euros, he finished the game scoreless against Georgia, marking the first time he has ended a group stage of an international tournament without a goal. [ 485 ] [ 486 ] Portugal was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinals by France, on 5 July, after losing 5–3 in a penalty shootout , despite Ronaldo scoring his spot kick. [ 487 ] He would finish the tournament scoreless, failing to score with any of his 23 shots at the tournament (including a missed penalty in the round of 16 against Slovenia ), the most attempts by a player without finding the net at a European Championship since the UEFA Euro 2004, when Deco had 24 shots without scoring for Portugal. [ 488 ] 2024–25 UEFA Nations League [ edit ] See also: 2024–25 UEFA Nations League Later that year, on 5 September, he scored his 900th career goal in a 2–1 victory over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League . [ 489 ] He became the first player to reach 900 career goals. [ 490 ] On 15 November, Ronaldo broke the record of most international victories with 132, overtaking Sergio Ramos's record, following a 5–1 victory against Poland in the UEFA Nations League, where he scored a brace. [ 491 ] Portugal topped their Nations League Group and qualified to the quarter-finals of the tournament. [ 492 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Real Madrid had previously recognised Ronaldo as their all-time top scorer after he scored a brace against Malmö FF on 30 September 2015. The club's official record book attributes to Ronaldo a 74th-minute goal in a 2–1 win over Real Sociedad on 18 September 2010, despite his free-kick having been deflected by Pepe . [ 176 ] ^ As of 2021, FIFA no longer recognizes Iran's match against Ecuador's Olympic team on 12 January 2000 as official, therefore costing Daei one goal.

Nicknamed CR7 , he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and has won numerous individual accolades throughout his professional footballing career , including five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards , four European Golden Shoes , and was named five times the world's best player by FIFA . [ note 3 ] He has won 33 trophies in his career , including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues and the UEFA European Championship . Ronaldo holds the records for most goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals (14) and assists (8) in the European Championship, and most international appearances (219) and international goals (136). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances , the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time. [ note 4 ] Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP , before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He went on to become a star player at United, as they won three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup ; his 2007–08 season earned him his first Ballon d'Or, aged 23. Ronaldo was the subject of the then- most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He was integral to Madrid becoming a dominant force again, as they won four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima . He won back-to-back Ballon d'Or awards in 2013 and 2014 , and again in 2016 and 2017 , and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi , his perceived career rival . He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and finished as the Champions League's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Madrid, Ronaldo's additional titles include two La Liga titles, including a record-breaking title win in 2011-12 , and two Copas del Rey . In 2018, following issues with the Madrid hierarchy, Ronaldo made a surprise transfer to Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million). He won several trophies in Italy, including two Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia , and broke several records for Juventus. He returned to United in 2021; despite a collectively disappointing season, Ronaldo's individual performances earned him being included in the PFA Team of the Year at 37 years old. His contract was terminated in 2022 due to a fall out with the newly appointed manager , and in 2023 he signed for Al-Nassr, a move that has since been widely credited for revolutionising football in Saudi Arabia. Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned than 200 caps , making him history's most-capped male player. [ 8 ] Ronaldo has played in eleven major tournaments and scored in ten; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004 , where he helped Portugal reach the final and subsequently made the team of the tournament . In the 2006 FIFA World Cup , his first World Cup, he was a focal part to Portugal ultimately finishing in fourth place. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008 ahead of Euro 2008 ; four years later, at Euro 2012 , he was named to the team of the tournament. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation . The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016 , being named in the team of the tournament for the third time and receiving the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement saw him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or . In 2018 , Ronaldo had his most prolific World Cup campaign and was voted in the Fan Dream Team . He led his country to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals , and also received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020 . In the 2022 World Cup , he became the first player to score at five World Cups. One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, 2023, and 2024 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente , in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde , and moved to Madeira Island at 16. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Kátia" . [ 2 ] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan , whom his father was a fan of. [ 18 ] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism , and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic , sharing a room with all his siblings. [ 21 ] As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, [ 22 ] where his father was the kit man, [ 13 ] and later spent two years with Nacional . In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP , who signed him for a fee of £1,500. [ 23 ] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system . [ 23 ] By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes , [ 24 ] to cease his education to focus entirely on football. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] With a troubled life as a student, [ 27 ] and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, [ 28 ] [ 29 ] he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him. [ 25 ] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia , a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. [ 32 ] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate . [ 33 ] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. [ 34 ] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel ( Sporting TV ) that her son would be a bricklayer if he had not become a professional football player. [ 35 ] Growing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário , and has described them as leaving "a beautiful history in football". [ 36 ] Club career Main article: Career of Cristiano Ronaldo § Club career Sporting CP After impressing in Sporting's youth teams , he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager László Bölöni .

[ 38 ] Over the course of the 2002–03 season , his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta . [ 39 ] Manager Arsène Wenger , who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal 's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer. [ 40 ] Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. [ 41 ] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo was "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.

[ 43 ] On 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12 million, [ 44 ] an England record for a teenager. [ 45 ] This also made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club. [ 46 ] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best , Eric Cantona and David Beckham . [ 47 ] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. [ 48 ] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career." [ 49 ] Ronaldo playing for Manchester United against Chelsea during the 2005–06 Premier League season Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003.

[ 57 ] "He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening." —Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season. [ 55 ] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season , producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.

[ 204 ] At UEFA Euro 2004 , he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to Greece in his eighth international appearance. [ 205 ] [ 206 ] Despite Portugal losing to Greece again in the final , Ronaldo made the team of the tournament , with two assists and two goals. [ 207 ] In the 2006 FIFA World Cup , at the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. [ 208 ] Portugal reached the semi-finals, where Portugal lost to France , with Ronaldo being booed during their defeat, due to an incident that occurred in the quarter-finals against England . [ 209 ] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany 's Lukas Podolski , citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision. [ 210 ] [ 211 ] Ronaldo, pictured playing against Germany at Euro 2012 , was made captain for Portugal in 2008. On 6 February 2007, Cristiano captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly against Brazil . [ 212 ] He wore the number 7 shirt ahead of UEFA Euro 2008 . [ 213 ] Despite scoring eight goals in qualifications , [ 214 ] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the finals, netting the second goal of Portugal's 3–1 win in the group stage game against the Czech Republic . Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 3–2 loss to Germany . [ 215 ] Ronaldo failed to score in 2010 World Cup qualifying . [ 210 ] He scored only one goal in the 2010 World Cup finals ; despite this, he was named man of the match in all three group stage matches, against Ivory Coast , North Korea and Brazil. [ 216 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 demolishing of North Korea, which was his first international goal in 16 months. [ 219 ] Two years later, in UEFA Euro 2012 , Ronaldo was joint top scorer with three goals, enough for him to be included in the team of the tournament. [ 6 ] During qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup , Ronaldo scored eight goals. Despite this, Portugal did not qualify directly; Ronaldo scored all four goals against Sweden in the play-off to qualify. [ 220 ] At the tournament in Brazil, Ronaldo assisted a last-minute 2–2 equaliser against the United States , [ 221 ] and scored an 80th-minute winner in a 2–1 win over Ghana . [ 222 ] Ronaldo leaps in the air in Portugal's Euro 2016 quarter-final match against Poland . In 2016, Ronaldo led Portugal to their first-ever trophy at the UEFA Euro 2016 , although he was subbed off in the 25th minute in the final against hosts France. [ 223 ] He received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer, which gave him his fourth Ballon d'Or later that year. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its only appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia , where they finished in third place, with Ronaldo being named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches. [ 224 ] [ 225 ] In the 2018 World Cup , Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, in a 3–3 draw against Spain . [ 226 ] The following match, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco , breaking Puskás' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. [ 227 ] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team . [ 228 ] Ronaldo led Portugal to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals , [ 229 ] and received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020 . Ronaldo also became the first player to score at five European Championships. [ 230 ] On 23 June 2021, Ronaldo scored two goals in the Euro 2020 match against France, breaking the men's goalscoring record previously held by Ali Daei . [ 231 ] Ronaldo during a group stage game against Uruguay at the 2022 World Cup On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos 's record for the most international caps received by a European player . [ 232 ] [ 233 ] In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, thus becoming the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football . [ 234 ] In the 2022 World Cup , on 24 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score at five World Cups, netting a penalty against Ghana. [ 235 ] Following a dispute with manager Fernando Santos , after their last group game against South Korea , he was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, [ 236 ] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000 . [ 237 ] On 23 March 2023, Ronaldo scored a brace against Liechtenstein as he earned his 197th overall cap to become the most capped male footballer of all time. [ 238 ] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers , as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. [ 239 ] On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their qualifying group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina , with Ronaldo scoring twice. [ 240 ] The landmark goals saw him score in than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s). [ 241 ] [ 242 ] With his start in Portugal's UEFA Euro 2024 opener against the Czech Republic , Ronaldo became the first player to feature in six European Championships, having previously been the first player to appear in five. [ 243 ] Later that year, on 5 September, he scored his 900th career goal in a 2–1 victory over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League . [ 244 ] Player profile Style of play At his peak, Ronaldo was known for his exceptional speed, explosive shooting, flair and athleticism. [ 245 ] A versatile attacker , Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, [ 246 ] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. [ 247 ] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints , [ 248 ] [ 249 ] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; [ 250 ] he has also been known to use the flip-flap . [ 251 ] His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. [ 252 ] [ 253 ] [ 254 ] Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history, measuring 2.93 metres (9 ft 7 in), which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013. [ 255 ] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability. [ 248 ] [ 252 ] In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward , or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. [ 252 ] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. [ 252 ] An accurate penalty kick taker, [ 256 ] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks . [ 257 ] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano . [ 258 ] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. [ 259 ] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: "People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him." [ 260 ] As Ronaldo entered his thirties he dribbled less frequently, [ 261 ] instead transitioning into a "deadly poacher". [ 262 ] At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became limited, although not entirely diminished. [ 263 ] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho , he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. [ 263 ] [ 264 ] [ 265 ] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. [ 266 ] [ 267 ] [ 268 ] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a "false", "attacking", or "goalscoring winger", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. [ 264 ] [ 269 ] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti , he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. [ 263 ] [ 270 ] [ 271 ] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane , a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities. [ 272 ] [ 273 ] [ 274 ] In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri , depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić . In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. [ 275 ] [ 276 ] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation. [ 277 ] [ 278 ] [ 279 ] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri . [ 276 ] Reception and image A Portugal fan at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa holding a banner dedicated to Ronaldo Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Argentina forward Lionel Messi . [ 280 ] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. [ 281 ] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, [ 282 ] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, [ 283 ] especially in important and high-pressured situations. [ 284 ] In a 2018 article for Bleacher Report , former NBA star Steve Nash compared Ronaldo to Michael Jordan : "On the pitch, [Ronaldo's] learned how to make his play—less explosive in individual movements— successful for the team, and in that, I see the greatness of Jordan." In the same article, Ronaldo was ranked first in the ranking of the 50 most influential people in sports culture for 2018. [ 285 ] "In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player." —Former manager Alex Ferguson , January 2013 [ 286 ] Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. [ 287 ] [ 288 ] On his longevity and "extraordinary commitment to physical preparation", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: "Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game." [ 261 ] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that "there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it." [ 289 ] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring. [ 290 ] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho , with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. [ 291 ] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. [ 292 ] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. [ 293 ] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to "his relative immobility" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high. [ 294 ] During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an "arrogant image" on the pitch, [ 295 ] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a "victim" because of how he was portrayed in the media. [ 296 ] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, [ 295 ] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. [ 296 ] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him. [ 297 ] [ 298 ] [ 299 ] Goal celebrations Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. [ 300 ] [ 301 ] [ 302 ] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion" [ 301 ] into his "signature power stance", [ 302 ] while usually simultaneously exclaiming "Sí" (Spanish and Italian for "yes"). [ 300 ] [ 303 ] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Siu" or siuuu in the media. [ 300 ] [ 301 ] [ 304 ] It has also been known as " suiii ", " siiuuu ", " siii " or " Right Here Right Now ", formally the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration . Since Ronaldo first performed the gesture in 2013, [ 305 ] it has been widely imitated by athletes and personalities both in and outside of football when celebrating scoring in respective sports or a significant achievement, and is widely regarded as the most iconic association football celebration of all time. [ 306 ] The gesture was first performed by Ronaldo on 7 August, during the 2013 International Champions Cup Final between Real Madrid and Chelsea . Ronaldo gave Madrid a 2–1 lead with a free kick when he headed in a cross from Isco , helping Madrid beat Chelsea 3–1 to claim the International Champions Cup and celebrating with his first "Siuuu". During an interview after the match against Chelsea when he first performed the gesture, Ronaldo explained he scored the goal and "it just felt natural" and "didn't know where it came from". He started doing it often and when the supporters see it they are reminded of him. [ 307 ] The phrase "siu" is derived from Portuguese sim , meaning "yes". This was confirmed by Ronaldo in an interview in 2023, almost a decade since he first performed it. Ronaldo explained that the phrase "Siuuu" simply means yes, but "meaning it very strongly". [ 308 ] Rivalry with Lionel Messi Main article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry Ronaldo with Lionel Messi before an international friendly between Portugal and Argentina in 2011 Both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals, have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season, and are the two leading goal scorers in history . Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. [ 309 ] It has been compared to several sports rivalries , among them the Muhammad Ali – Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. [ 310 ] [ 311 ] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. [ 312 ] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character. [ 313 ] [ 314 ] [ 315 ] "It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent." —Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi. [ 316 ] In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high." [ 317 ] Alex Ferguson , Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best." [ 318 ] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano." [ 319 ] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players." Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh it together, stating: "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing." [ 316 ] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico , which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events. [ 320 ] In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has expenses for the hairdresser than the other." Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's "commander" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. [ 321 ] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year , with Ronaldo stating: "I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football." [ 322 ] After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup , a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi settled the debate between the two players. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and "gone", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of "sharing the stage".

[ 384 ] [ 385 ] In 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas , the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is "a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city". [ 386 ] Public art Public artwork of Ronaldo include a waxwork likeness in Madame Tussauds , London (left) and a bronze statue in Madeira (right), resembling the pose he strikes before taking free kicks. In June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard , Pelé, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London . [ 387 ] Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. [ 388 ] A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014. [ 389 ] [ 390 ] The unveiling of the rebranded Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. [ 383 ] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live , [ 391 ] [ 383 ] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; [ 392 ] however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018. [ 393 ] Business ventures Ronaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. [ 394 ] In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai , Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. [ 395 ] He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. [ 396 ] [ 397 ] In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, "Legacy", in a partnership with Eden Parfums. [ 398 ] Since 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre ( Correio da Manhã , Record and Jornal de Negócios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Expressão Livre. [ 399 ] In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano , created by developer RockLive , [ 400 ] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo , a dedicated social networking website and app. [ 401 ] Media Ronaldo's autobiography, titled Moments , was published in 2007. [ 402 ] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit , in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011. [ 312 ] Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet , a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch , was released via Vimeo in June 2014. [ 403 ] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke his life and career, titled Ronaldo , was released on 9 November 2015. [ 404 ] [ 405 ] He appears as a playable character in the 2025 fighting game Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves . [ 406 ] Personal life Family, children, and relationships Ronaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. [ 407 ] He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. [ 408 ] [ 409 ] In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended. [ 410 ] Ronaldo became a father to twins , [ 411 ] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy . He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez , [ 412 ] who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. [ 413 ] The couple expected another set of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived. [ 414 ] Ronaldo's father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20. [ 415 ] Ronaldo is of (one-eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. [ 416 ] He is a Catholic. [ 417 ] After her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi , MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce , have featured her in commercials. [ 418 ] [ 419 ] [ 420 ] [ better source needed ] Health Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol , [ 366 ] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. [ 421 ] He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow . [ 422 ] Legal issues In July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. [ 423 ] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend. [ 424 ] Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution. [ 425 ] In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. [ 426 ] [ 427 ] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$ 375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement . [ 426 ] [ 428 ] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an "intentional defamation campaign" with parts significantly "altered and/or completely fabricated", [ 429 ] [ 430 ] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. [ 431 ] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: "Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt ." [ 432 ] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. [ 433 ] The Daily Mirror , citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo. [ 434 ] In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, "acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute" the case, despite the documents containing "privileged communications" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having "intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement" during the 2010 settlement with her. [ 435 ] In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada , as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of "cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents" were actions representing "abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process".

Cristiano has an elder brother, Hugo and two elder sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia. His name was inspired by the former US-president, Ronald Reagan, whom his father was influenced by. The island of Madeira was also the place where Cristiano first learned to master his skills as a footballer. He spent his early years playing for his local team, Nacional, and by the time he turned 12 years old, he already made his name for himself as one of Madeira's top footballers . It wasn't long before he started to catch the attention of other big Portuguese clubs. Among Sporting was Benfica, a team Cristiano and his father followed as a young boy. However he eventually chose to play for Sporting which was a team his mother loved and followed as she was growing up, to play with the likes of Figo was the dream for her son. He was then spotted by former Liverpool manager, Gerard Houllier at the age of sixteen but Liverpool had no intentions to sign him at that time because they thought he was too young and he needed time to develop his skills. However, in the summer of 2003, when Sporting played against Manchester United and defeated them, Cristiano caught the attention of Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player. Initially, he requested for the number 28 as his jersey number because he didn't feel that he could live up to the pressure of previous players such as George Best and David Beckham who wore the number 7 jersey. The year 2006 to 2008 proved to be a rather controversial year for the star. In the 2006 World Cup, Cristiano faced accusations regarding his sportsmanship. In a quarter-final match against England, he was heavily criticized for sending of his club team mate, Wayne Rooney who was playing for the England team. It wasn't too long until fans started accepting Cristiano again. In 2007, he won PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Player of the Year, PFA Fans' Player of the Year, Portuguese Footballer of the Year, FWA Footballer of the Year, Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year and Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year. The year 2008 also saw him taking back the PFA Player Of The Year Award for the second time running. That same year, Ronaldo also had to deal with controversies regarding his club transfer to Spanish giants, Real Madrid. He eventually chose to stay with Manchester United and stressed to the public that he had no intentions of leaving the club. Cristiano now lives with his cousin, Nuno and his brother in law Ze. When he is not on the field, he is a very family oriented person. Growing up, when he was to choose football as his career, he said that it was very difficult for him as that would mean lesser time with his family, especially his mother, whom he says play a major role in his life. During his free time, Cristiano enjoys cooking. He mentioned in an interview that he usually cooks before he leaves for his soccer practice. Because he is constantly training, Cristiano rarely has time to watch TV. If he does get the time to watch, he says he loves watching one of the local Portuguese game show which is mostly trivia questions. Cristiano is an avid learner and he takes interest in learning new things everyday. Among Cristiano's biggest pet peeves are smoking, people who don't make an effort and dishonesty. When the tsunami hit South East Asia, Cristiano flew to Indonesia to help those in need. He auctioned off a few stuff to help raise funds for charity. He hopes to get involved in charity projects in the future because he believes his star status will help him reach out to others for help. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Ezequiel De Castilla Family Children Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. Alana Martina dos Santos Aveiro Mateo Ronaldo Eva Maria Dos Santos Bella Esmeralda dos Santos Aveiro Trivia After playing against Manchester United in a pre-season friendly the Manchester United players urged the manager to sign Cristiano on the the plane back to Manchester. Was signed by Manchester United as a long term replacement for David Beckham . Became the most expensive teenager in Britain in 2003. Scored Manchester United Football Club's 1,000th league goal against Middlesbrough Football Club. Flew to Indonesia to visit the areas affected by the tsunami and raised over 1 billion rupiah by auctioning off his personal sports gear. 50 All Quotes I would be very proud if, one day, I'm held in the same esteem as George Best or Beckham. It's what I'm working hard towards. Lots of young players have triumphed at United, so why can't it happen to me? I'm not worried I'm young - it's an incentive to do the best I can. The No 7 shirt is an honor and a responsibility. I hope it brings me a lot of luck. There is no harm in dreaming of becoming the world's best player. It is all trying to be the best. I will keep working hard to achieve it but it is within my capabilities. I've never tried to hide the fact that it is my intention to be the best 15 All Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Learn contributing Edit page from this person View agent, publicist, legal and company details on IMDbPro to explore Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb app for access for access Follow IMDb on social Get the IMDb app For Android and iOS Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo License IMDb Data Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Your Ads Privacy Choices IMDb, an Amazon company © 1990- 2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.
